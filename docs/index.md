### Question 1     
How to find if there is a sub array with sum equal to zero?          
Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.     

### Question 2           
How to find sub array with maximum sum in an array of positive and negative number?         
Here you have to find the contiguous sub-array within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.     

### Question 3    
How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array?     
Given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any subset of given set. Expected time complexity is O(n).
