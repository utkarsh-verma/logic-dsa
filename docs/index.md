### Question 1     
How to find if there is a sub array with sum equal to zero?          
Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.           

**Example** 
Input: {4, 2, -3, 1, 6}
Output: true
There is a subarray with zero sum from index 1 to 3.
Input: {4, 2, 0, 1, 6}
Output: true
There is a subarray with zero sum from index 2 to 2.
Input: {-3, 2, 3, 1, 6}
Output: false
There is no subarray with zero sum.

### Question 2           
How to find sub array with maximum sum in an array of positive and negative number?         
Here you have to find the contiguous sub-array within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.         

**Example**       
given the array [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4],
the contiguous subarray [4,−1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.     

### Question 3    
How to find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of any subset of a given array?     
Given a sorted array (sorted in non-decreasing order) of positive numbers, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of elements of any subset of given set. Expected time complexity is O(n).        

**Example**     
Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 15};
Output: 2
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1};
Output: 5
Input:  arr[] = {1, 1, 3, 4};
Output: 10
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40};
Output: 4
Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
Output: 22
